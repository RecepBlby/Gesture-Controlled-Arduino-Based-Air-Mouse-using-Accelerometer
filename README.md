# Gesture Controlled Arduino Based Air Mouse using Accelerometer
 
Nintendo a gaming company sells out an idea of a 3D interactive method to interact with their consoles with the help of a handheld controller known as Wii controller. It uses the accelerometer to locate your gestures for a game and send it to the system wirelessly. If you want to know more about this technology you can check out their patent EP1854518B1, this will give you a complete idea of how this technology works.

Inspired by this idea we are going to make an "Air mouse", to interact with systems just by moving the console in the air, but instead of using 3-dimensional coordinate references, we are only going to use 2-dimensional coordinate references so we can imitate the actions of the computer mouse since the mouse works in two dimensions X and Y.

The concept behind this Wireless 3D Air Mouse is very simple, we will use an accelerometer to get the value of the acceleration of the actions and motions of the “Air mouse” along the x and y-axis, and then based on the values of the accelerometer we will control the mouse cursor and perform certain actions with the help of the python software drivers running on computer.

To control your computer with the movements of your hand you need an accelerometer that gives out the acceleration along the X and Y-axis and to make the whole system wireless a Bluetooth module is used to transfer the signal wirelessly to your system.
